CipherPay: High-Speed, Privacy-Preserving Payments for the Next Generation of Decentralized Finance
________________


Abstract
CipherPay is a single-chain, privacy-preserving payment protocol designed to deliver fast, modular, and programmable private transfers with an exceptional user experience. Built for the modern decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, CipherPay enables shielded transactions with zero-knowledge proofs, gasless relayers, programmable privacy flows, and selective auditability. It is initially launching on Solana (or Ethereum L2) and will later integrate with CipherDEX to support private trading settlements.

1. Introduction
Abbreviations Used:
* TVL: Total Value Locked — the total amount of assets deposited in a DeFi protocol or ecosystem, used as a measure of platform size or usage.

* UX: User Experience — the overall experience a user has while interacting with a product, especially in terms of ease, efficiency, and satisfaction.

As DeFi evolves, privacy remains a foundational challenge. Users demand anonymity in transfers, but without sacrificing speed, interoperability, or usability. Most existing solutions—like Zcash, Tornado Cash, or Railgun—fail to deliver all three. CipherPay addresses this by combining Solana's or L2's speed with modular zkCircuits, a full relayer mesh, and programmable transaction flows.

2. Motivation
CipherPay is built to:
   * Offer shielded, zero-knowledge-based private transfers

   * Abstract gas and IP identity using relayer networks

   * Provide modular, composable payment logic (e.g. streaming, conditional)

   * Enable selective auditability without compromising global anonymity

   * Deliver full user experience via SDK and privacy wallet

3. Core Features
3.1 Shielded Transfers
CipherPay uses zero-knowledge circuits (e.g., Circom or RISC Zero) to enable completely private token transfers, hiding sender, receiver, and amount.
3.2 Gasless UX via Relayer Mesh
Users sign encrypted meta-transactions. Relayers submit the txs and cover gas in exchange for zk-included fees, providing a seamless experience without public wallet activity.
3.3 Modular Payment Circuits
CipherPay supports advanced zk-payment flows:
      * zkStream: time-based drip payments

      * zkSplit: one-to-many private payouts

      * zkCondition: payments only released upon zk-proven conditions

3.4 Selective Disclosure
Audit-compliant design allows users to share specific transaction proofs without revealing full transaction graphs. View keys and zkProof-of-payment flows are supported.
3.5 Developer SDK and Wallet
CipherPay provides a wallet SDK with private balance tracking, encrypted transaction history, stealth addresses, and embedded relayer logic. DApps can use the SDK to integrate privacy into payroll, tipping, DAO voting, and more.
To ensure seamless onboarding and compatibility with widely-used tools, CipherPay supports a light wallet model that integrates with existing traditional wallets like MetaMask (for EVM) and Phantom (for Solana). These traditional wallets serve as signature providers and funding sources for shielded vault interactions.
Workflow Overview:
         * Deposit Phase:

            * User connects via MetaMask or Phantom.

            * CipherPay SDK requests a signed transaction to deposit tokens into the vault.

            * Once deposited, the SDK generates a zk-commitment.

               * Shielded Transaction Phase:

                  * CipherPay wallet handles private transfers using generated zk-proofs.

                  * MetaMask/Phantom are not used during this stage, as transfers are shielded.

                     * Withdrawal Phase:

                        * When user wants to exit the shielded pool, the SDK generates a zk-proof for withdrawal.

                        * The user signs the withdrawal tx with MetaMask/Phantom.

This hybrid wallet design provides a familiar experience while enabling advanced privacy features. CipherPay provides a wallet SDK with private balance tracking, encrypted transaction history, stealth addresses, and embedded relayer logic. DApps can use the SDK to integrate privacy into payroll, tipping, DAO voting, and more.

4. Architecture Overview
  

  

Clarification: The Relayer Network is not a blockchain. It is a decentralized network of off-chain services (e.g., Node.js microservices) that help users submit shielded transactions to the CipherPay smart contract. These relayers:
                           * Accept encrypted meta-transactions from users

                           * Cover gas costs (gas abstraction)

                           * Submit zk-proofs to the blockchain

                           * Obscure user metadata (e.g., wallet origin or IP address)

They do not perform consensus, do not store blockchain state, and do not act as a separate ledger. Final settlement and zk-proof verification still occur on the base chain (e.g., Solana or Arbitrum).
Figure: CipherPay Shielded Transfer Workflow
This diagram shows the full process from deposit to shielded transfer and recipient reaction, illustrating how MetaMask/Phantom wallets interact with CipherPay Wallet SDK, Relayer Network, and CipherPay Smart Contracts.
Note: While User B's CipherPay Wallet listens for new commitments and adds matched private notes, User B does not submit a zk-proof to a public wallet during receipt. A zk-proof is only submitted:
                              * When User B reshields the note by initiating a new shielded transfer (handled within the CipherPay wallet), or

                              * When User B withdraws publicly, in which case the zk-proof is used to authorize withdrawal and MetaMask/Phantom is used only to receive funds.

CipherPay is structured around a shielded vault account model. The process flow is as follows:
                                 1. Initial Deposit with Public Wallet:

                                    * User A connects with a traditional wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Phantom).

                                    * The user sends tokens (e.g., ETH or SOL) to the CipherPay Vault smart contract.

                                    * The vault receives the deposit and emits a confirmation.

                                       2. CipherPay Wallet Shielding:

                                          * User A uses the CipherPay Wallet SDK to convert their deposit into a shielded note.

                                          * The wallet generates a zk-proof, nullifier, new commitment (for the recipient), and includes the current Merkle root.

                                          * An encrypted transaction is prepared.

                                             3. Relayer Network Submission:

                                                * The encrypted transaction (with zk-proof, commitment, nullifier) is sent to a Relayer.

                                                * The Relayer submits the zk-proof to the CipherPay Smart Contract on-chain and pays the gas fee.

                                                   4. On-Chain Validation:

                                                      * The CipherPay Smart Contract verifies the zk-proof.

                                                      * If valid:

                                                         * The Merkle tree is updated with the new commitment.

                                                         * The nullifier is registered to prevent double-spending.

                                                         * An event is emitted containing the new commitment.

                                                            5. Recipient Reaction (User B):

                                                               * User B’s CipherPay Wallet listens for shielded transaction events.

                                                               * If the event contains a note addressed to them (using stealth address or view key), they decrypt and store the note.

                                                               * User B can:

                                                                  * Reshield the note in another private transfer, or

                                                                  * Withdraw publicly using a zk-proof.

This modular process guarantees privacy while maintaining composability and user control over funds.
CipherPay is structured around a shielded vault account model. Users deposit public tokens into a vault smart contract that manages encrypted balances via zero-knowledge commitments. The system follows a classic zk-UTXO model with nullifier protection and Merkle tree state tracking.

                                                                                 * Scans incoming encrypted notes using viewing key

                                                                                 * Matches the encrypted note, decrypts, and adds to local wallet note database

                                                                                       * The proof is verified by the CipherPay smart contract.

                                                                                                   * zkProof-of-payment can be generated and verified for individual transactions.

This architecture ensures fast, anonymous, and gasless user experiences while maintaining robust zk-based verification and decentralized recordkeeping.

                                                                                                                           * This proof is sent through a Relayer Network, which anonymizes the transaction origin and pays gas fees.

                                                                                                                           * The Relayer forwards the zk-proof to the CipherPay smart contracts deployed on Solana.

                                                                                                                           * Upon verification, the smart contract updates the Merkle tree and nullifier state, finalizing a shielded transfer.

                                                                                                                           * User B receives the private funds in their shielded balance, without knowledge of the sender or the transaction amount being leaked.

This architecture ensures fast, anonymous, and gasless user experiences while maintaining robust zk-based verification and decentralized recordkeeping.

                                                                                                                                    * Off-chain: encrypted tx metadata, wallet keys

                                                                                                                                          * DeFi users and yield farmers who want privacy over portfolio activity

                                                                                                                                          * Institutional DeFi needing compliant, auditable private settlements

                                                                                                                                          * DAOs and payroll systems for private compensation distribution

                                                                                                                                          * Cross-border remittance users requiring high-speed, low-fee private transfers

8. Compliance Considerations
CipherPay is designed with a forward-looking approach to compliance. While privacy technologies have historically faced regulatory scrutiny—such as the OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash—CipherPay adopts a balanced model:
                                                                                                                                                      * Selective Disclosure: Built-in view keys and zkProof-of-payment mechanisms allow users to generate verifiable, auditable records for compliance when needed.

                                                                                                                                                      * No Custodianship: CipherPay is a non-custodial protocol with user-controlled keys and open-source infrastructure, reducing regulatory liabilities.

                                                                                                                                                      * Modular Relayer Framework: Relayers can be independently operated by KYC/AML-compliant entities or users themselves.

                                                                                                                                                      * Compliance-Ready SDK: Businesses and DAOs can build on CipherPay while maintaining transparency to auditors or legal counsel.

CipherPay will remain open to collaboration with regulators to promote privacy-preserving technologies that align with evolving financial compliance standards.

9. Future Directions
Multi-Chain Deployment (Not Cross-Chain)
CipherPay is designed to support deployment on multiple blockchains independently, without requiring cross-chain interaction. Each chain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot) operates its own isolated CipherPay vault, nullifier registry, and zkVerifier, enabling shielded transfers natively on that chain.
Key Design Principles:
                                                                                                                                                         * Each chain runs an independent instance of the CipherPay smart contracts and shielded Merkle tree.

                                                                                                                                                         * zk-circuits are shared across chains but adapt to each chain’s parameters (e.g., Merkle root, chain ID).

                                                                                                                                                         * The CipherPay Wallet SDK detects the connected chain and routes shielded transactions to the correct deployment.

Relayer Architecture:
                                                                                                                                                            * Each blockchain has its own dedicated relayer pool to ensure compatibility with gas models and node APIs.

                                                                                                                                                            * Ethereum relayers submit zkProofs to the CipherPay vault on Ethereum.

                                                                                                                                                            * Solana relayers handle the proof submission and fees specific to Solana.

                                                                                                                                                            * Polkadot relayers (if supported) work through Substrate-compatible proof and runtime integrations.

Benefits:
                                                                                                                                                               * Enables native privacy-preserving transfers on multiple chains.

                                                                                                                                                               * No zk-bridging or wrapped assets are needed.

                                                                                                                                                               * Keeps user experience consistent across networks.

Limitations:
                                                                                                                                                                  * Privacy pools and user balances are chain-specific.

                                                                                                                                                                  * Users must switch chains in their wallet to access balances on each network.

This architecture simplifies integration while enabling broad privacy coverage across leading ecosystems.

                                                                                                                                                                     * A small fixed or percentage-based fee is embedded in every shielded transfer via zero-knowledge proofs.

                                                                                                                                                                     * These fees can be routed to a protocol treasury or directly to governance/staking pools.

2. Relayer Micro-Fees
                                                                                                                                                                        * Users leveraging CipherPay relayers will pay a micro-fee (shielded tip) as part of their encrypted transaction.

                                                                                                                                                                        * Relayers can be run by the protocol operator or decentralized through an open registration system.

3. SDK and API Licensing
                                                                                                                                                                           * While the base SDK is open-source, premium modules (e.g., zkPayroll, zkDonations, zkAudit) can be licensed to DAOs, institutions, and fintechs.

4. White-Label Deployments
                                                                                                                                                                              * CipherPay can be integrated into third-party DeFi apps, wallets, or payroll systems as a privacy layer, with custom deployment or maintenance fees.

5. zk-Proof-as-a-Service (zkPaaS)
                                                                                                                                                                                 * Hosted zkVerifier or zkProver microservices can be monetized as APIs for lightweight apps or enterprise users.

6. DAO Tokenization (Optional)
                                                                                                                                                                                    * In the long term, protocol ownership and revenue governance can be shifted to a DAO model with a token.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * This would enable staking incentives, relayer slashing, and treasury grants.

These monetization paths offer a blend of early-stage operability and long-term economic sustainability, whether as a bootstrapped protocol or a decentralized privacy infrastructure.
                                                                                                                                                                                       * Integration with CipherDEX for private trade settlement

                                                                                                                                                                                       * zkBridge relay module for cross-chain opt-in transfers

                                                                                                                                                                                       * Support for private stablecoins (e.g., zkUSDC)

                                                                                                                                                                                       * zk-SNARK + STARK hybrid provers
